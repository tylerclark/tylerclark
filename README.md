### Howdy ðŸ¤ 
Former lead engineer and architect at Salesforce, the New York Times, and SurveyMonkey. I'm a full-stack developer and lover of frontend and backend systems. This expertise allows me to create websites, web apps and mobile apps from start to finish with precision and scalability. I've been featured in prominent publications such as the [Business Journal](https://www.bizjournals.com/tampabay/inno/stories/profiles/2023/10/24/veterinary-medtech-ai-company.html) and [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/special/contributor-content/2023/10/19/from-silicon-valley-to-pet-care-umbrella-ai-vision-for-ai-infused-vet-care/71242317007/) and has appeared on [ABC](https://www.abcactionnews.com/news/region-hillsborough/tampa-tech-pro-creates-app-that-connects-pet-owners-with-live-veterinarians) and Fox affiliates.
