### Howdy 🤠
I'm Tyler Clark, Founder of [Clarky](https://clarky.ai), an AI layer for businesses. We make it incredibly simple to spin up an AI agent (less than 1 minute) that can chat on your website, answer phone calls and booking appointments, reply to texts, and auto-replying to emails. In addition we also have a mini-CRM so keeping up with leads is pretty easy. We also work with tons of integration partners in various industries. Check out our website (we have a free tier), read about us in the [Business Journal](https://bizj.us/1qo4d4), [book some time with me](https://meet.clarky.ai) to learn more!

I also run a small consultancy called [Clark Interactive](https://clarkinteractive.com) where we build fantasic mobile apps and business websites.

Former lead engineer and architect at Salesforce, the New York Times, and SurveyMonkey. I'm a full-stack developer and lover of frontend and backend systems. This expertise allows me to create websites, web apps and mobile apps from start to finish with precision and scalability. I've been featured in prominent publications such as the [Business Journal](https://www.bizjournals.com/tampabay/inno/stories/profiles/2023/10/24/veterinary-medtech-ai-company.html) and [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/special/contributor-content/2023/10/19/from-silicon-valley-to-pet-care-umbrella-ai-vision-for-ai-infused-vet-care/71242317007/) and has appeared on [ABC](https://www.abcactionnews.com/news/region-hillsborough/tampa-tech-pro-creates-app-that-connects-pet-owners-with-live-veterinarians) and Fox affiliates.
